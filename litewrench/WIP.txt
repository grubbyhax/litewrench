This is the notes documentation to get the lite framework in order.

CHANGELOG FULL VERSION
- copy acrross form object and test(swap in GLB_FOREMAN).
- need to do radio buttons as the next step to getting the notice form built.
	- put in th javascript to handle the radio buttons in the same way as the checkboxes

I've changed some of the framework model database configurations and values so do a reinstall of the framework.


Shortlist of tasks:

IMMEDIATE:
MUST MOVE THE APIU MODIFICATIONS TO THE PLAN->BIND->BUILD ROUTINES INTO THE FULL SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD
	- the plan use plugin variable is going to call up a plugin object to do the build
	- the override file path is alos going to pull up a plugin object to make the build execution.

-I need to be up and developing the application so:
	- save and load model functions need to be tested
	- form validation and model binding needs to be confirmed as working.

-Need to figure out the basic routing, what are we going to hit as the primary logic control point?
	- MUST TEST THE REGEX. I SHOULD APPLY THE WRAPPER COMMANDS SUCH AS () +?
	- must also make sure that the regex matches are tested against the start of the uri string
-I'm going to gut all the DOM Document functions out of this framework and keep it to a db style of data storage with themes + locales.
	- Got to move the builder functions and the pluin functions into the command object

- Need to be able to set headers in the command object so that I can send PDF files.
	- This will also help for outputting files.
